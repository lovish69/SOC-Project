SOC Project - Security Operations Center (SOC) Simulation

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is a Security Operations Center (SOC) simulation, where I set up a Windows victim machine and a Linux attacker machine to analyze security logs, detect threats, and simulate adversary tactics.

ðŸ”¹ Key Objectives:

âœ… Learn SOC fundamentals and security monitoring.
âœ… Set up a Windows & Linux lab environment.
âœ… Use Sysmon, LimaCharlie (EDR), and Sliver (C2) for threat detection.
âœ… Perform malware simulations and analyze detections.

| Category          | Tools Used |
|------------------|------------------|
| **Operating Systems** | Windows 11, Ubuntu Server |
| **Security Monitoring** | Sysmon, Windows Event Logs |
| **EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response)** | LimaCharlie |
| **Command & Control (C2)** | Sliver |
| **Forensics & Detection** |  Regedit |

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
ðŸ”¹ Part 1: Setting Up the SOC Lab

âœ… Installed Ubuntu Attacker Machine & Windows 11 Victim Machine.
âœ… Disabled Windows Defender & Security Services (via Registry & GPO).
âœ… Installed Sysmon to collect detailed event logs.
âœ… Installed LimaCharlie (EDR) to monitor endpoint activity.

ðŸ”¹ Part 2: Establishing Command & Control (C2)

âœ… Set up Sliver C2 Framework on Ubuntu.
âœ… Generated a malicious payload and transferred it to Windows.
âœ… Executed the payload and established a C2 connection.
âœ… Interacted with Windows using Sliverâ€™s implants (process list, privilege escalation).
âœ… Observed real-time detections in LimaCharlie EDR.

ðŸ”¹ Part 3: Advanced Threat Simulation & Log Analysis
âœ… Attacking on victim machine with sliver
âœ… Taking on credentials
âœ… detection
